New button type: Button with - Short Press / Long Press (+ time to decide), don't send when pressed, but when short press time is finished
LCD improvement: only send changed characters (copy characters from display in array, costs 4x20 = 80 bytes max), but goto-xy also takes time
LCD improvement: send only one character per interrupt (to spread the transmit times)
